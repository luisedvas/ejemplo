    <h1>The Dillinger Escape Plan</h1>
    <p>One Of Us is the Killer</p>
    <p>Lyrics:<br>
    you're an image pale that points and laughs<br>
    a white mistress in a fiery bath<br>
    now tie me down and take me home<br>
    I'm not afraid to go<br>
    shake the roots off of the tree<br>
    your conscience fades<br>
    eyes have no vision to see<br>
    your soul degrades<br>
    grey follows in front of me<br>
    you've lost your way<br>
    every life is but a death to me<br>
    eventually the jokes aren't free and<br>
    nothing's ever fun and<br>
    nothing's funny<br>
    blunt self belief too big to fall<br>
    lead shadow stands just inches tall<br>
    I hope to god you never die<br>
    your joke is just my type<br>
    but now I see the joke's on me<br>
    don't be scared<br>
